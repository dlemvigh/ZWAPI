        <div style="font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold; text-align: center">Java API for Z-Wave communication</div>
        <p>
            This api is used to model and control nodes in a Z-Wave network. Basic network setup,
            inclusion/exclusion of nodes isn't currently handled by the API. This should be handled using which ever Z-Wave inclusion
            controller happens to be handy at the time. To model the network the node ID of all nodes in the network must be known.
        </p>
        <p>
            A code example of modeling a Z-Wave network with a single node:
        <pre>
        {@code
        ZWNetworkController controller = new ZWController(nodeID, portIdentifier);
        ZWNetwork network = new ZWNetwork(controller);

        ZWNode aNode = ...
        network.addNode(aNode);
        }
        </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Control operation are then be called on the node objects, which then use the
            network controller to send the message to the physical Z-Wave device. An event based
            listener recieves reports from the network, and notifies the model by firing an event
            on the corrosponding node object.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sensors should can have association to directly control the lamps, when motion is detected. Sensors should also
            have the network controller associated, so sensor event can be logged. Should it be
            necesary the sensor events recieved though the API could be used to trigger new actions. This practice of
            centrallized communication should be avoided if possible, in order to comply with Z-Wave standards.
        </p>
        <p>During the development the api was tested using a TrickleStar Z-Wave dongle, but any Z-Wave serial controller should work.</p>
